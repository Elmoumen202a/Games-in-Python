## Overview

In this project, we aim to develop fun and interactive games using Python. Whether you're a beginner looking to enhance your programming skills or an experienced developer wanting to explore game development, you're in the right place.

## Games

Here are the games currently included in this project:

1. **Hangman Game**
   - The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game that challenges players to uncover a hidden word letter by letter. Here's a brief overview of the game setup and rules:
     - **Game Setup:**
       - **Players:** Hangman is designed for two or more players, with one player as the word selector and others as the guessing players.
       - **Word Selection:** The selecting player chooses a word for guessing players to uncover, represented by underscores.
       - **Scaffold:** The selecting player draws a scaffold to hold the hangman illustration.
     - **Guessing:**
       - **Letter Selection:** Guessing players take turns selecting letters to reveal the hidden word.
     - **Feedback:**
       - **Letter Appearance:** The selecting player provides feedback on whether the guessed letter appears in the word.
       - **Word Progress:** Correct guesses reveal the positions of the letters in the word.
       - **Incorrect Guesses:** Incorrect guesses lead to drawing the hanged man incrementally.
     - **Winning Conditions:**
       - **Selecting Player Wins:** The selecting player wins if the hanged man drawing is completed after six incorrect guesses.
       - **Guessing Players Win:** Guessing players win if they successfully guess the entire word before reaching the maximum incorrect guesses.
