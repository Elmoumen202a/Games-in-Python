# Blackjack Game

This is a simple text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python.

## How to Play
1. Run `main.py` using Python.
2. You'll be dealt two cards, and the dealer will also have two cards, with one card face-up.
3. You can choose to 'hit' to get another card or 'stand' to keep your current hand.
4. If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without going over, you win.
5. If your hand goes over 21, you bust and lose the game.

## Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, execute `tests.py`. The tests verify the correctness of card dealing and scoring logic.
