# Hangman Python Project

🎮 Welcome to the Hangman Python Project! 🐍

## Project Overview
This Hangman game will involve a computer and one human player. The computer, acting as the selector, chooses the word to guess, processes human input, and manages all output. The human player, referred to as the "player," guesses letters until they either complete the word or run out of guesses. Remember, the game loop continues until the player either successfully guesses the word or exhausts all attempts.

Get ready to Python and have fun coding! 🚀🐍

Happy coding! 🎉
