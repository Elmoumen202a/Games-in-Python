# Hangman Python Project

🎮 Welcome to the Hangman Python Project! 🐍

   - The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game that challenges players to uncover a hidden word letter by letter. Here's a brief overview of the game setup and rules:
     - **Game Setup:**
       - **Players:** Hangman is designed for two or more players, with one player as the word selector and others as the guessing players.
       - **Word Selection:** The selecting player chooses a word for guessing players to uncover, represented by underscores.
       - **Scaffold:** The selecting player draws a scaffold to hold the hangman illustration.
     - **Guessing:**
       - **Letter Selection:** Guessing players take turns selecting letters to reveal the hidden word.
     - **Feedback:**
       - **Letter Appearance:** The selecting player provides feedback on whether the guessed letter appears in the word.
       - **Word Progress:** Correct guesses reveal the positions of the letters in the word.
       - **Incorrect Guesses:** Incorrect guesses lead to drawing the hanged man incrementally.
     - **Winning Conditions:**
       - **Selecting Player Wins:** The selecting player wins if the hanged man drawing is completed after six incorrect guesses.
       - **Guessing Players Win:** Guessing players win if they successfully guess the entire word before reaching the maximum incorrect guesses.

## Project Overview
This Hangman game will involve a computer and one human player. The computer, acting as the selector, chooses the word to guess, processes human input, and manages all output. The human player, referred to as the "player," guesses letters until they either complete the word or run out of guesses. Remember, the game loop continues until the player either successfully guesses the word or exhausts all attempts.
